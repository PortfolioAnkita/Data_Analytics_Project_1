# Data_Analytics_Project_1

In this project , I Have perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the World Air Quality Index dataset. The dataset contains information about air quality measurements in different cities around the world. I will explore the data, visualize key insights, and derive meaningful analytics from it.

â€‹ Project Overview 
As we breathe, the quality of the air we inhale profoundly impacts our health, environment, and overall quality of life. To understand and address the challenges of air pollution, we turn to data. In this project, we embark on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a comprehensive World Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset, leveraging Python's powerful tools to uncover insights and patterns hidden within this vital information.

1.2. Data description and sources 
Source - World Air Quality Index by City and Coordinates
Format - .csv
Variables - AQI values with respect to countries and their cities, Pollutant concentrations (CO, Ozone, NO2, PM 2.5) values and categories, latitude and longitude of respective cities.
Understanding the Pollutants -
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carbon Monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless gas primarily generated by incomplete combustion of fuels in vehicles, power plants, and household appliances. CO inhibits oxygen delivery to tissues, leading to headaches, dizziness, and impaired cognitive function at high concentrations. Prolonged exposure can be fatal.

Ozone (O3): A secondary pollutant formed by chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. Ozone irritates the respiratory system, causing coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness, and exacerbates asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Elevated ozone levels also contribute to smog formation.

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): A reddish-brown gas primarily emitted from vehicle exhaust and industrial processes. NO2 directly irritates the lungs and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, further impacting air quality and human health.

Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5): Microscopic particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, easily inhaled deep into the lungs. PM 2.5 originates from various sources, including vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and dust. Exposure to PM 2.5 is linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer.

Understanding the AQI Categories -

The Air Quality Index (AQI) helps us understand how clean the air is with simple categories and colors.

Good (Green, 0-50): Like taking a deep breath in a forest! Air quality is excellent, posing minimal health risks. Enjoy outdoor activities!

Moderate (Yellow, 51-100): Air quality is acceptable, though sensitive individuals might experience minor irritation. Consider limiting strenuous outdoor activities if you have concerns.

Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange, 101-150): Sensitive individuals, like children and those with asthma, may experience breathing difficulties. Consider reducing outdoor activities, especially for these groups.

Unhealthy (Red, 151-200): Everyone can start feeling the effects of air pollution. Reduce outdoor activities and consider wearing a mask, especially if you have health concerns.

Very Unhealthy (Purple, 201-300): Air quality is hazardous! Minimize outdoor activities and stay indoors as much as possible. Vulnerable individuals should take extra precautions.

Hazardous (Maroon, 301+): Emergency conditions! Stay indoors and avoid all outdoor activities. Follow official health advisories to protect your health.
